**NoVPN** is an application that enables you to make a whitelist of apps that should always bypass android's VPN service.
**NoVPN** uses [*iptables*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iptables) and can be used to fix VPN apps that do not work in some LineageOS kernels ([151](https://github.com/guardianproject/orbot/issues/151), [2193](https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/2193)) simply by selecting the VPN app in the whitelist as well.

Note that **root access** is required for this app to work at all.
